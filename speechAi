# Speech AI

Speech AI is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to understand, generate, and interact using human speech.  
It combines **speech recognition**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **speech synthesis** to allow humans to communicate with computers through voice.

## Core Components of Speech AI

- **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition):** OpenAI Whisper, DeepSpeech (Mozilla), Google Speech-to-Text, Wav2Vec2.0  
- **TTS (Text-to-Speech):** Google WaveNet, Tacotron 2, Amazon Polly, Microsoft Azure TTS  
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing):** GPT-4, BERT, Rasa NLU, Dialogflow

## The Speech AI Pipeline

1. **Speech Input (Analog Signal Capture)**  
   Capturing the audio signal through microphones or other input devices.  

2. **Preprocessing & Feature Extraction**  
   - Removing noise and filtering  
   - Breaking down audio into frames  
   - Fourier Transform & Spectrograms  

3. **Acoustic Modeling**  
   - Maps audio features to phonemes  
   - Compares extracted features with trained phoneme patterns  
   - Predicts which phonemes are spoken  

4. **Language Modeling (Context & Grammar)**  
   - Helps choose the correct word sequence  
   - **Example:**  
     - Acoustic model hears: *“wreck a nice beach”*  
     - Language model corrects: *“recognize speech”*  

5. **Decoder (Final Speech-to-Text)**  
   - Combines acoustic model + language model  
   - Outputs the most likely transcription  
   - **Example:** *“Book me a flight from Delhi to Bangalore tomorrow morning.”*  

6. **NLP & Intent Recognition**  
   - Understands the meaning of the transcribed text  
   - Tasks: Tokenization, POS tagging, entity recognition  
   - Intent classification → `BookFlight`  
   - Extracted slots:  
     - Origin = Delhi  
     - Destination = Bangalore  
     - Date = Tomorrow  
     - Time = Morning  

7. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
   - Converts text back into speech for system response  
   - **Steps:**  
     - Text Normalization → *“7 AM” → “seven a.m.”*  
     - Phoneme Conversion → Maps text to phonemes  
     - Prosody Generation → Adds stress, rhythm, intonation  
     - Neural Vocoder → Converts phonemes + prosody into waveform  

   - **Models:** WaveNet, Tacotron 2, HiFi-GAN

## Challenges in Speech AI

- **Accents & Dialects:** Variability makes recognition difficult  
- **Background Noise:** Real-world noisy environments hinder accuracy  
- **Code-Switching:** Mixing multiple languages in speech (common in India)  
- **Real-Time Performance:** Requires low latency for smooth interactions  
- **Bias & Fairness:** Models trained mostly on English/Western accents may underperform on others
