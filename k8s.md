REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE

0         <none>

\# It's shown only if the rollout history is empty or has no complete ReplicaSet for that revision.

2         <none>

3         <none> 

The first rollout didn’t generate a complete ReplicaSet.



You deleted and re-created the Deployment, skipping revision 1 internally.



Or revision 1 was garbage collected if old replicaset history was cleaned up (default max history is 10).
