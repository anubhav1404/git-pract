# OpenAI Overview

**OpenAI** is an artificial intelligence research company founded in **December 2015** by **Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, and others**.

It is both a **research lab and product organization** that develops **large-scale generative AI systems** across **language, image, audio, and multimodal domains**.  
These systems are made accessible through **APIs** and consumer products like **ChatGPT, Codex, DALL·E, Whisper, and Sora**.  

Their public-facing work includes **research papers, system cards, model releases, and product/API documentation**.

## Core Areas of Development

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** → GPT family (text generation, reasoning).  
- **Image generation** → DALL·E.  
- **Speech recognition** → Whisper.  
- **Multimodal AI** → GPT-4 with vision (text + image).  
- **Video generation** → Sora.

## How OpenAI Works

### 1. Training Data
- Models like **GPT-4** are trained on massive datasets: books, articles, code, and online text.  
- The model learns **patterns of language**: grammar, facts, reasoning, problem-solving.

### 2. Neural Network (Transformer Architecture)
- The foundation is the **Transformer model**.  
- Text is broken into **tokens** (subword units).  
- The system predicts the **next token** step by step.  
- Example: “The sun rises in the…” → prediction = **“east”**.

### 3. Inference / Response Generation
- Models don’t **look up answers**; instead, they generate them.  
- Responses are created by predicting tokens **one at a time**, based on probability.

## GPT Family (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

- **GPT-2** → 1.5 billion parameters.  
- **GPT-3** → 175 billion parameters.  
- **GPT-4** → parameters undisclosed (estimated **1–2 trillion**, using a mixture of experts).  

**Tasks**: Natural Language Understanding, Text Generation, Complex Reasoning, and Problem Solving.

## Key OpenAI Models and Systems

### 🔹 GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
- Flagship NLP model.  
- Powers **ChatGPT**.  
- Capable of: dialogue, reasoning, summarization, translation, coding assistance, and more.  
- Extended into **multimodal reasoning** in GPT-4 (vision + text).

### 🔹 Codex
- **Fine-tuned GPT model on code repositories (like GitHub)**.  
- Specializes in understanding and generating source code.  
- Supports over a dozen programming languages.  
- Powers **GitHub Copilot**, an AI pair programmer that suggests code completions and solutions in real time.  

---

### 🔹 DALL·E
- **Text → Image generation** using **diffusion models**.  
- Generates high-quality, creative images from natural language prompts.  
- **DALL·E 3** integrates tightly with GPT-4 for **better prompt interpretation and contextual accuracy**.  
- Applications: creative design, marketing, concept art, rapid prototyping.  

---

### 🔹 Whisper
- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** system.  
- Converts **spoken audio → text**.  
- Multilingual and robust against accents, background noise, and technical jargon.  
- Applications: transcription, captions, real-time translation, voice assistants.  

---

### 🔹 Sora
- **Text → Video generation** system.  
- Uses **diffusion models extended to the time dimension**.  
- Capable of generating realistic and cinematic video clips from written descriptions.  
- Early-stage model with huge potential for entertainment, simulation, and content creation.  

---

### 🔹 GPT-4o (Omni)
- OpenAI’s **multimodal “omni” model**.  
- Supports **text, vision, and audio** inputs simultaneously.  
- Enables **real-time reasoning** across modalities:  
  - E.g., you can show it an image, ask a question about it, and receive a spoken answer.  
- Breakthrough in **low-latency interaction** → feels conversational in real-time voice and video.
