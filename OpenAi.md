OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research company founded in December 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, and others.OpenAI is an AI research and product organization that develops large-scale generative AI systems (language, image, audio, multimodal) and exposes them through APIs and consumer products (ChatGPT, Codex, image and speech tools). Their public-facing work mixes research papers, system cards, model releases, and product/API docs.



OpenAI develops state-of-the-art AI systems for:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) → GPT family (text generation, reasoning).
Image generation → DALL·E.
Speech recognition → Whisper.
Multimodal AI → GPT-4 with vision (text + image).

How OpenAI Works
1) Training Data
OpenAI’s models (like GPT-4) are trained on massive amounts of text: books, articles, code, and online content.
This helps them learn patterns of language — grammar, facts, reasoning styles, and even problem-solving.
2)Neural Network (Transformer Architecture)
The core is a Transformer model.
It processes text by breaking it into tokens (subword pieces) and predicting the most likely next token step by step.
Example: If you type “The sun rises in the…”, the model predicts “east” as the next token.
3) Inference / Response Generation
When you give a prompt, the model doesn’t “look up answers.”
Instead, it predicts the next words based on probabilities learned during training, until it forms a coherent response. it generates a respose one token at a time

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
GPT-2 → 1.5B parameters.
GPT-3 → 175B parameters.
GPT-4 → undisclosed (estimated 1–2T parameters, mixture of experts).
task: Natural Language Understanding & Generation and reasoning 

🔹 Codex
GPT model fine-tuned on source code (GitHub, etc.).
Powers GitHub Copilot.
🔹 DALL·E
Text → Image generation.
Uses diffusion models.
DALL·E 3 integrates deeply with GPT-4 for better prompt interpretation.
🔹 Whisper
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
Converts speech → text.
Multilingual, robust to accents and noise.
🔹 Sora (newer)
Text → Video generation.
Extends diffusion models to time dimension.
🔹 GPT-4o
Multimodal "omni" model: text + vision + audio.
Real-time reasoning across multiple modalities.
